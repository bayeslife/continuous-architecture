## Characteristics

A characteristic is the name for a domain of values which are required to configure a service specification such that it can be realized as an instance.

## Characteristic Groups

Characteristics are placed into Groups related to functions of single responsibility.
They can be in more than one characteritic group.

## Service specification Characteristics

A service specification is associated to any number of characteristic groups and its defined by the union of all characteristics in the groups associated to it.

## Characteristic Values

Characteristic Values are members of the domain of values which can be used to configure the behaviour of the service.

## Characteristic value types

As services are instantiated the values associated to Characteristics are captured.

The values can be:
- references to Charactistic Values
- references to Services
- reference to resources
- free text values

## Valid Characteristic Values

Constraints can constrain the Characteristic Values which are valid for services

## Service Characteristics

Services require values for all charactistics associated to all characteritic groups associated to the service
