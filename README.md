#  Continuous Architecture

The goal with continuous architecture is to facilitate a population of architects working together to design solutions that are consistent with each other.

## Key outcomes

The key outcomes are
- to provide feedback to architects as quickly as possible that architecture models are consistent with architectural standards and system constraints
- to provide consistency of published outputs
- to be provide mechanisms to validate as built contracts and maintain up to date inventory


The first of these is of primary value to the architect and fundamentally represents test which operate against the models developed by the architect in the context of inventory created by previous architects.

The second is needed to inform and influence stakeholders in making business decisions and guiding test and development activities.

The third is a mechanism to allow architects to govern the services which are released to ensure consistency with design.

## Usage

## Paradigm

### Solution Catalogue Data

This module describes functionality with respect to a catalogue of solution data.

[see SolutionData](./SolutionData.md)


### Verifications

This module publishes a set of verifications intended to be used within the pipeline.

Here is a list of verifications which can be realized to achieve the outcomes.

[see Verifications](./Verifications.md)



### Components

Here is a proposed set of components which can be used to realize the paradigm.
